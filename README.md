## Introduction

This project is a simple web application built using **Streamlit** and **NLTK** that classifies SMS messages as spam or not spam using a machine learning model. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled SMS messages and utilizes natural language processing techniques to predict the likelihood of a message being spam.

## Features

- Classify SMS messages as spam or not spam
- Utilizes a machine learning model trained on a dataset of labeled SMS messages
- Employs natural language processing techniques for text analysis
- Provides a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Pickle

## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
